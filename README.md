Dense Feature
===============
In this package, you find MATLAB code for extracting dense Color Histogram and dense SIFT feature from a given image. 

Remarks
========
- The core function (sp_dense_sift.m) come from Scenes/Objects classification toolbox http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29800-scenesobjects-classification-toolbox
- The core function (sp_dense_color.m) is a modified MATLAB version of the denseCOLOR.cpp in the toolbox without loss of computation efficiency.
